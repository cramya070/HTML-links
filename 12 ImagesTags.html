    A beautiful woman feels beautiful within, <br>
    from the love she gives to her ideas and<br>
     the creative ways she expresses her soul.<br>
      She is one who wraps her arms around the soul of the world, <br>
      of all who love her and those who need to love. <br>
    That's beauty and if you can see that too, <br>
    you'll be smarter and wiser than most.<br>
