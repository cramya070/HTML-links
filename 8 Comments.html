You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
<!-- Write your comments here -->
With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:
<!-- This is a comment -->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- Remember to add more information here -->
Comments can be used to hide content.

This can be helpful if you hide content temporarily:
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- <p>This is another paragraph </p> -->

<p>This is a paragraph too.</p>
You can also hide more than one line. Everything between the <!-- and the --> will be hidden from the display.
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!--
<p>Look at this cool image:</p>
<img border="0" src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
-->
<p>This is a paragraph too.</p>
Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code.
<p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>
